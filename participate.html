            The Choice Coin Network is glad to announce ways in which participants can get Choice Coin.
            The Network is rewarding direct democratic participation by giving Choice Coin to participants who write letters to their local congressmen
            or representatives about blockchain or decenteralized governance.
            The Choice Coin Network hopes that this program will inspire participants to not only participate in their democracy,
            but also spread the word about how decenteralized technology can change democratic practices for the better.
            Second, the Network will reward writers who write blogs and articles, thus promoting communication about democratic practices and blockchain.
            Finally, developers who contribute to Choice Coin's Open-Source Software Program will be rewarded by the network as well.
            This is meant to incentivize developers to contribute freely to Choice Coin's software stack. Find out more in our terms and conditions below.
